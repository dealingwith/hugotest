    Sonder | The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows from John Koenig on Vimeo. Sonder &ndash; n. &ndash; the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own—populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness—an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.

    Originally written and published (I assume only to a few close friends) before I had even started blogging, in 2001. It was part of an exercise in exploring the text by rewriting it in a new context. Of the many things I wrote in that time, it seems to hold up the best. It was a strange time, 2001. It was even stranger in the city. No where else could you find such a diversity of things and people smashed into such a small geographic location.

    Some perspective. Son Lux (BreakThru Radio Session) by Son Lux Whenever I need perspective I go find this photograph. It is the greatest regret of my life, leaving behind for even one second the daughter who would one month later be taken from me. When I go to work these days Lucy says &ldquo;Come back. Miss you.&rdquo; and leans in plaintively for a kiss. When I get home from work these days Lucy says &ldquo;Yay!

    I read two articles today that at first don&rsquo;t seem to have anything to do with one another but connected for me in a profound way that I&rsquo;m going to attempt to capture in this post. I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot lately about how the web has changed since I first started participating in it at around the turn of the century. This is the one I read first, and it&rsquo;s a bit on the long side, but I recommend your read the entire thing.

    I&rsquo;ve hesitated and put off writing about this project for a number of reasons. I&rsquo;ve been busy. The project itself, while completely necessary, took a lot of energy to complete, let alone promote. I haven&rsquo;t done the work yet to get the record onto your favorite subscription music services, or even Amazon and iTunes. And it&rsquo;s been hard to find enough superlatives with which to describe my friends who helped me.

    From &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not you, it&rsquo;s meme&rdquo; by Richard Stevens See also: &ldquo;Analogjam&rdquo;. Ben Werdmüller posted something that&rsquo;s apparently going around, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m making 50 pieces of art. Do you want one?&rdquo; and I quite liked the sentiment, that is that to participate you must independently web-publish something indicating your interest. Which led me to indiewebify.me, a collection of tools and protocols for cataloging and connecting the &ldquo;indie web&rdquo; (13 years ago when I started blogging we just called it &ldquo;the web&rdquo;).

    Blogging&ndash;the oldest, most abused topic on all blogs since the 1990&rsquo;s! In fact, the entire post I was going to write has already been written by Adactio, who links to, among others, the following: Jeffrey Zeldman: Yes, recycling other people’s recycling of other people’s recycling of cat gifs is fun and easy on Tumblr. Yes, rubbing out a good bon mot on Twitter can satisfy one’s ego and rekindle a wistful remembrance of meaning.

    I met Matt Alexander at XOXO this year. He&rsquo;s been a bit busy, but at the one other occasion I ran into him I complimented him on his writing for Need&hellip;turns out his degree is in English Lit. Then he drops this: In a world of carefully curated spheres of information and insight, it&rsquo;s all-too-easy for us to feel we&rsquo;re simply abiding by the societal norms dictated by those around us.

    We should not love our kindred alone for their genius and glory, but also for their homely virtues and domestic affections that expanded and flourish unobserved save by the little world in which they moved. From the preface to &ldquo;The Descendants of Captain Thomas Carter&rdquo;, a book tracing (some of) my lineage back to the son of a &ldquo;London merchant of good family.&rdquo;
