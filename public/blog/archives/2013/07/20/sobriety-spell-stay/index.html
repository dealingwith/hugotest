          <p>My six months of sobriety technically ended last Wednesday but I&rsquo;m in what I&rsquo;m referring to as &ldquo;penalty time&rdquo;.{% fn_ref 1 %} And like penalty time in a soccer match, the imminence of the end makes the next week{% fn_ref 2 %} just feel like a long Friday. Or that part of summer camp where all the kids are getting picked up but you&rsquo;re one of the last few to leave.</p>

<p>I intended to add additional weight-reducing and (hopefully) happiness-increasing behaviors throughout the six months but failed at every other attempt. I blame the amount of will power it has taken to not drink. I&rsquo;m hoping that the lack of cellular interest{% fn_ref 3 %} will result in a dramatic decrease in alcoholic intake compared to where I left off six months ago. Even if only to keep these extra ten pounds I lost off! I&rsquo;m hoping that allowing myself the freedom to drink will allow for some will power to be spread across other beneficial behaviors.{% fn_ref 4 %}</p>

<p>Those behaviors include meditation, sleep improvement, core strength conditioning, diet improvement. We&rsquo;ll see what I can do. I&rsquo;ve been incredibly busy lately. Work isn&rsquo;t overwhelming but it certainly requires some extended hours. And Lucy&rsquo;s at a perfect age that I don&rsquo;t want to miss a blink of. Between those two factors and normal &ldquo;life&rdquo; stuff, I barely have time to ride just a few hours a week, and my weight has been creeping back up despite the alcohol-free lifestyle. None of those three can be changed, really, so I do what I can.</p>

<p>One thing I did notice during this time was the experience of very lucid happiness. I mentioned <a href="http://blog.danielsjourney.com/2013/02/04/weeks-seven/" title="Iâ€™ve been fighting clinical depression for over two years while taking dose after dose of depressives most every night. Pretty f**king stupid.">before</a> that not blocking my anti-depressants was one of my motivations and sure enough, it seemed to work. For sure, I want to be careful to not indulge enough to counteract the progress I&rsquo;ve made in that area. I&rsquo;m on a path to get off the medications, which of course I would like to do.{% fn_ref 5 %}</p>

<p>{% footnotes %}
  {% fn I &ldquo;slipped up&rdquo; about 5 times over the 6 months. Two of those were towards the beginning and I look back at those with bemusement at this man who couldn&rsquo;t imagine a life without <em>some</em> alcohol. Two were more recently and they were both incredibly anti-climatic. Like, &ldquo;Wow, that wasn&rsquo;t enjoyable at all. Weird.&rdquo; %}
  {% fn I am officially having a few drinks with friends in celebration next Friday. The date had as much to do with scheduling the get-together as it did with serving some additional time for transgressions. %}
  {% fn Of course I&rsquo;m referring to addiction but I&rsquo;m hesitant to use that term due to the fact that almost everyone who uses that term finds their condition to be permanent and requiring of intense treatment. They also probably found their condition to profoundly effect their daily life in a very destructive way. I did not see myself in that camp, but I could see the writing on the wall if I continued unconstrained. %}
  {% fn Yeah, did you know willpower is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion">limited resource</a>?) %}
  {% fn And of course distance from <a href="http://2010.danielsjourney.com/">past events</a> is also of a great benefit in that area. %}
