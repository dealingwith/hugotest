          <p><strong>The Travel</strong></p>

</p>

<p>As far as these things go, I thought my family did very well with the actual-travel portions of our Portland trip this year. (Here&rsquo;s <a href="http://blog.danielsjourney.com/2012/09/23/xoxo/">last year</a>&rsquo;s post, in case you weren&rsquo;t aware this has become an annual event.) The only hitch was when we arrived very late to Portland and were met with the <em>worst</em> domestic car rental experience I have ever endured. Whatever you do, never rent from <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/advantage-car-rental-portland#hrid:oj7pmES5lP4-TtjNWtMX9g">Advantage Car Rental</a>; they are terrible. I made the mistake of not checking out their horrible Yelp reviews prior to booking.</p>

<p><strong>XOXO</strong></p>

</p>

<p><a href="http://2013.xoxofest.com/">XOXO</a> will require its own post but overall I enjoyed it more than last year. The speakers were once again excellent but for some reason the &ldquo;theme&rdquo; that evolved over the course of the three days seemed more real and practicable than last year. I talked to more people this year which was another plus. And I didn&rsquo;t stress about the parts I missed in the evenings. I just enjoyed my time in Portland with my family.</p>

<p>There were goats across the street, and <a href="https://twitter.com/urbangoatspdx">they</a> were <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23xoxofest%20goats&amp;src=typd">a hit with just about everyone</a>.</p>

</p>

<p>The first day of XOXO was pretty free-form, so I took the oportunity to hang out with my friend Scott, and we all went to a food truck pod for grilled cheeses inside a double decker bus.</p>

</p>

<p>Later we had to drive back to the airport to exchange our rental car (more of the terrible experience) after which we went straight to the <a href="http://gobytram.com/">arial tram</a>, after which we hung out in the coffee shop at the bottom and played in a fountain in a nearby park. I like how my family can have fun pretty much anywhere. We enjoy the simple things in life, and Portland provides a great platform for that enjoyment.</p>

</p>

<p>The next day during the lunch break I rode to River City Bicycles and enjoyed some free espresso and finally got a shop cap for my collection (last year they didn&rsquo;t have any).</p>

<p>The rest of the family did some shopping as well, Lucy fits in well aesthetically.</p>

</p>

<p>And before we had to leave, the kids had their Voodoo Doughnuts and Salt and Straw ice cream. We know what&rsquo;s up, Portland.</p>
