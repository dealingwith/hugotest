<p>I took a few minutes over the weekend to redesign the single-page <a href="http://danielsjourney.com">danielsjourney.com</a>. The <a href="http://blog.danielsjourney.com/2011/01/22/new-danielsjourney/">previous design</a> was something I was really proud of and received a lot of attention, but its time had passed. This was also my excuse to check out <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>, which I ended up not using (it is intended for web applications), and <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/">responsive web design</a> which I knew a lot about but had yet to put into practice anywhere; and while this was a very simple example, it at least gave me the confidence of having implemented <em>something</em>.</p>

<p>Life has once again settled into a pleasant routine. School and the baby force us out of bed and Carissa and I take turns either holding Lucy or taking Penn to school. I get ready for and go to work.</p>

<p>Work continues apace, full of all the challenges I signed up for. Life-stuff continues to happen, refusing to stop long enough for me to contemplate boredom. The house is comfortable, pretty and always in need of repair.</p>

<p>In the evenings we have dinner together and then I hold Lucy while Carissa puts Penn to bed. Then she takes Lucy and puts her to bed, sometimes falling asleep with her. I&rsquo;m usually not far behind.</p>

<p>I still make plans, as we all do. For this spring I&rsquo;m hoping to do a few epic <a href="http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2011/10/23/century.html">rides</a>, continue work on my next record and finish a few other projects that have been hanging around for a while. Here&rsquo;s a little teaser of that record. I&rsquo;m cautiously hoping to have it out in the fall.</p>
