<p>The original title of this post when I started it almost six months ago was &ldquo;Strava and the continued douchification of bicycling&rdquo;. But since then <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120619/gps-app-strava-sued-over-cyclists-death/?refcat=news">enough has been said</a> about <a href="http://strava.com">Strava</a> and I actually like Strava quite a bit except for the stupid{% fn_ref 1 %} segments. I&rsquo;m afraid the real problem is the way cycling seems to attract a certain type of person with not just a lack of character, but a lack of basic appreciation for the beauty of our world or other people.</p>

<p>This, I think, is a factor of approaching the sport not just from a competitive standpoint, but one that actually opposes what I would consider a more honorable way: that of riding a bicycle as an aesthetic, and ascetic, pursuit.</p>

<p>I realized that many of my posts about cycling have to do with this aesthetic. <a href="http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2011/01/09/corner.html">Turn</a>; <a href="http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2011/02/07/super-bowl.html">Super Bowl</a>; <a href="http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2011/02/20/ride.html">When in Doubt, Ride Hard</a>; <a href="http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2011/03/07/bikes.html">Hell, Let&rsquo;s Keep Talking About Bikes</a>; <a href="http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2011/07/16/dear-fellow-recreationalists.html">Dear Fellow Recreational&hellip;</a>; <a href="http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2011/05/26/yapab.html">Yet Another Post About Bicycling</a>; <a href="http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2011/09/27/leroica.html">L&rsquo;Eroica</a>; <a href="http://blog.danielsjourney.com/2012/01/01/rapha/">The 2011 Festive 500</a>.</p>

</a></p>

<p>So instead of putting more words to the topic, I thought I&rsquo;d just share some more examples. Thing is, even though as I recently observed with some friends, &ldquo;Bike racing attracts a certain kind of douchebag,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s not really about racing or not racing. It&rsquo;s about the central Thing. If that Thing is numbers or ego, then the aesthetic is likely lost. If it is about man, machine and motion, well, that&rsquo;s a better start. A desire not just for the attainable win, but for the ever-ellusive <a href="http://redkiteprayer.com/2011/04/souplesse/">souplesse</a>.</p>

</a></p>

<p>One of the best ways to understand the aesthetic of which I speak is through photography. One of my favorite photographers in this genre is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smashred/">Jered Gruber</a>. He was kind enough to allow me to use some of his photographs in this post.</p>

</a></p>

<p>Another group of people who get this, despite being some of the fastest people in the world, are those of the <a href="http://www.slipstreamsports.com/">Garmin-Sharp-Barracuda</a> professional cycling team. They had a sub-par Tour de France; both their leaders crashed out of the race; although they still later won a stage in dramatic fashion. Here are some highlights from just a month ago, when things were going much better:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don’t even use a computer or speedometer or anything anymore, unless I’m going way out of the Lehigh Valley and figure I’ll want to use a Garmin to find my way home eventually. Sometimes even then, though, I just wing it. I like the idea of winging it. Of being something on the wing. I like that better than knowing how long I spent in zone five.</p>
