          <p>Today I found out <a href="http://hauntedgeographies.typepad.com/">Nic Hughes</a> lost his ongoing fight with cancer. He was a loved husband, father, friend, designer and thinker. He was barely older than I. He was a peer and an idol at once. After Margot&rsquo;s death he wrote me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear Daniel,
I think we’ve briefly met once and have occasionally exchanged email and comments from time to time. I talked to Steve at Greenbelt and he confirmed what I suspected from your twitter feed&ndash;that Margot did not make it.</p>

<p>I have no way of understanding this or coming close to your experience, apart from, that I have kids too. In the end, words are completely inadequate. This is to show solidarity and say that I’m thinking of you in this unfathomable moment of loss.</p>

<p>Hope this is not too invasive? Take care,
Nic Hughes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the way home from the office, where I was when I heard, I was somehow drawn to memories of a host of those we&rsquo;ve lost. I found myself listening to <a href="http://www.carteralbrecht.com/">Carter</a>&rsquo;s record. I happened to drive by where earlier this year we saw <a href="http://blog.danielsjourney.com/2012/01/01/rapha/">a teenage girl killed</a>.</p>

<p>Later, in reply to my helpless email of remorse, our mutual friend <a href="http://www.kesterbrewin.com/">Kester</a> replied:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From afar, with the dignity and rage with which you dealt with your loss, you&rsquo;ve already been such a help.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to conceive of the fact that my own suffering gives space for others&rsquo;, but I guess it is true. While I cannot create a narrative that accounts for our loss of Nic&hellip;while I only recently, in a moment of personal reflection, discounted all narratives that gave meaning to our loss of Margot&hellip;in it lies a bit of something that provides some meaning to others. As I discovered today, Nic once wrote me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Narrative is gold.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amen to that, and godspeed, Nic.</p>

<p>Here is something I recorded for Nic (as requested of many by his friends before his passing). It might give you a little insight into what Nic meant to me:</p>
