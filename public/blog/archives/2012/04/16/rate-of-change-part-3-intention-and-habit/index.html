<h3 id="toc_0">Intention</h3>

<p>I secretly hate this word. Most of the time I see it used it is referring to some ideal where every decision is cognitively aligned with some higher purpose, those decisions are always correct and time is never wasted.</p>

<p>Additionally, intentionality and attention are closely related and frequently conflated.</p>

<p>For my purposes what I mean by intentionality is most closely related to will. We intend to do something and we do that thing, as opposed to the easier thing, or the more short-sighted thing, or the more immediately gratifying thing.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that we wouldn&rsquo;t behave in certain ways if we didn&rsquo;t secretly enjoy it. Be it stuffing our face with unhealthy foods or getting involved in a dramatic Facebook thread, it takes a strong will (or a life changing experience) to overcome behaviors that are contrary to our intent. (However I will be the first to advocate for a healthy hedonism in life.)</p>

</a></p>

<p>There are a lot of biological reasons for this and I don&rsquo;t really want to explore them right now. From a more philosophical perspective, Viktor Frankl would say that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=MmKta5tymPY">our will to pleasure and our will power come from a frustrated will to meaning</a>, which I frequently conflate with intentionality for my own purposes.</p>

<p>Meaning/calling/will/intentionality&hellip;they all describe different characteristics of the self that we all accept as existent{% fn_ref 1 %} but have a hard time capturing practically either emotionally or intellectually. But it is the kind of thing <a href="http://youtu.be/RYlCVwxoL_g?t=10s">we know when we see it</a>.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">Habit</h3>

<p>Eventually, if we will ourselves to do something long enough, it becomes habit and our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_control#As_a_limited_resource">tired will</a> can take a breather (before starting in on the next thing). I have a long-standing and slightly overly-obsessive interest in meaning and identity formation, but also with habit formation and behavior modification; and specifically in regards to the latter, technological tools that intend to help us change.</p>

<p>Before tools{% fn_ref 2 %}, however, are simply techniques.</p>

<p>The first is quantification; keeping track of the behavior you want to change. It works for a variety of reasons&ndash;by drawing our attention to the issue in question, by illuminating facts about ourselves we otherwise would not see&ndash;and it probably works for a variety of non-obvious reasons as well.</p>

<p>I will point you to the <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/" title="A place for people interested in self-tracking to gather, share knowledge and experiences, and discover resources.">Quantified Self</a> website as a rather complete and always expanding compendium of information on the subject. I will also point you to this video, which has a much more personal take on the same subject:</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/31401743" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>

<p>The other really important technique is accountability. This one is well known, but I have found this one thing to be helpful: don&rsquo;t bother setting up accountability agreements with people particularly close to you{% fn_ref 3 %} and, if possible, arrange to be held accountable by a person whose primary interaction with you is around said accountability. Trainer, coach, therapist, pastor.</p>

<p>Another form of accountability is the use of a <a href="http://blog.beeminder.com/akrasia/">commitment device</a>, however I find they are best used in conjunction with&ndash;not as a replacement for&ndash;good old-fashioned human accountability.</p>

<p>Other techniques include a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_pact">Ulysses pact</a> (really a specific kind of commitment device) (refer also to <a href="http://bustr.me/post/18441500095/why-loss-aversion-isnt-a-great-behavior-change-tool">this commentary</a>), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aversion_therapy">aversion therapy</a> and a host of others. In fact there are tons of good books on this subject that I should probably have read before writing a few paragraphs on the subject.</p>
