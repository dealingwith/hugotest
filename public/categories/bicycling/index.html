    {% img left /images/rapha-festive-500-2012-v1-100.jpg Festive 500 Complete badge %} It was harder than last year but I managed it. I&rsquo;m not sure why it was harder except for the fact that it was consistently 10-30 degrees colder than it was last year, but that just made it feel more authentic. I also rode my second-ever century (the first) on many roads I&rsquo;d never ridden on before, which was painful but left me with a great feeling of accomplishment.

    The original title of this post when I started it almost six months ago was &ldquo;Strava and the continued douchification of bicycling&rdquo;. But since then enough has been said about Strava and I actually like Strava quite a bit except for the stupid{% fn_ref 1 %} segments. I&rsquo;m afraid the real problem is the way cycling seems to attract a certain type of person with not just a lack of character, but a lack of basic appreciation for the beauty of our world or other people.

    It didn&rsquo;t go so bad. I finished. I was doing ok until about 2 laps to go when I had that sudden feeling like all the blood was running out of my head and I watched the pack of riders disappear up the road in front of me. I actually did not know how many laps were left so when I came across the start/finish line by myself and saw the 2 laps remaining sign I also realized that I was going to finish the race w/o being lapped/pulled or otherwise not finishing.

    &hellip;managed to crawl out of bed in time to make the morning ride and I never regret it when I do. I pieced together a few different routes and we ended up with a really pleasant 54 miles. The temperature was pretty perfect (about 70F), the legs felt good, clouds protected us from the Texas sun (now they&rsquo;re watering our [still] parched land, which makes me even happier to have gotten a ride in early) and there were no flats or any other types of trouble.

    Guilt The Rapha Festive 500 is a worldwide challenge to ride 500km from the 23rd to the 31st of December. (Rapha makes very nice cycling garments as well as those cool videos I post all the time.) Last year it was the impetus for my return to regular cycling and the kickoff to a year filled with thousands of miles, new friends, lost pounds and a new appreciation for the further reaches of both my abilities and the town in which I reside.
