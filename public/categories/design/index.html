    One topic my post from yesterday did not specifically address was music. Coincidentally, Andy Baio recently posted a thorough investigation of cover songs on YouTube that speaks to many of the issues on both sides of the intellectual property debate. We all break laws. Every day, millions of people jaywalk, download music, and drive above the speed limit. Some laws are obscure, others are inconvenient, and others are just fun to break.

    image by flickr user qthomasbower Me ranting about intellectual property rights is not new in any way but I wrote this in an email to my Extra Sauce coworkers after some confusion about what images they could use when posting to social networks on our clients&rsquo; behalf and it seems like a reasonable summary of the subject and unfortunately still timely given the amount of copyright infringement sites like Tumblr and Pinterest engender.

    &ldquo;Hi Ian,&rdquo; writes one. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed that the Cowpocalypse has happened and users have to pay to see their cow. Do you have a goal or timeframe of when this will be set back to normal?&rdquo; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way to pay to see your cow,&rdquo; replied the designer. &ldquo;The cows got raptured.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve written about Ian Bogost before, and recently two excellent articles recapping the history of his Cow Clicker Facebook game crossed by desk (via Marco).

    Via BERG: &ldquo;John Kestner’s Tableau is a nightstand that drops photos it &lsquo;sees&rsquo; in its Twitter feed into its drawer, to be discovered by its owner.&rdquo; Tableau: physical email from John Kestner on Vimeo. John Kestner is part of the Information Ecology team at the MIT Media Lab, so of course I&rsquo;m going to gush a bit, but check out some videos of his other projects as well as the rest of his portfolio.

    Dieter Rams: ten principles for good design Good design is as little design as possible Less, but better – because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials. There might be more than one school of thought in design, but there is only one school of thought that is right.
