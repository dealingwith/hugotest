      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I found out &lt;a href=&#34;http://hauntedgeographies.typepad.com/&#34;&gt;Nic Hughes&lt;/a&gt; lost his ongoing fight with cancer. He was a loved husband, father, friend, designer and thinker. He was barely older than I. He was a peer and an idol at once. After Margot&amp;rsquo;s death he wrote me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Daniel,
I think we’ve briefly met once and have occasionally exchanged email and comments from time to time. I talked to Steve at Greenbelt and he confirmed what I suspected from your twitter feed&amp;ndash;that Margot did not make it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no way of understanding this or coming close to your experience, apart from, that I have kids too. In the end, words are completely inadequate. This is to show solidarity and say that I’m thinking of you in this unfathomable moment of loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this is not too invasive? Take care,
Nic Hughes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way home from the office, where I was when I heard, I was somehow drawn to memories of a host of those we&amp;rsquo;ve lost. I found myself listening to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.carteralbrecht.com/&#34;&gt;Carter&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s record. I happened to drive by where earlier this year we saw &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.danielsjourney.com/2012/01/01/rapha/&#34;&gt;a teenage girl killed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, in reply to my helpless email of remorse, our mutual friend &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kesterbrewin.com/&#34;&gt;Kester&lt;/a&gt; replied:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From afar, with the dignity and rage with which you dealt with your loss, you&amp;rsquo;ve already been such a help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to conceive of the fact that my own suffering gives space for others&amp;rsquo;, but I guess it is true. While I cannot create a narrative that accounts for our loss of Nic&amp;hellip;while I only recently, in a moment of personal reflection, discounted all narratives that gave meaning to our loss of Margot&amp;hellip;in it lies a bit of something that provides some meaning to others. As I discovered today, Nic once wrote me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrative is gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amen to that, and godspeed, Nic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smallfire.org/vaux_gifted.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/space.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is something I recorded for Nic (as requested of many by his friends before his passing). It might give you a little insight into what Nic meant to me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re curious about the things I mention in that audio, check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smallfire.org/vauxpage1.html&#34;&gt;Vaux&amp;rsquo;s page on smallfire.org&lt;/a&gt; or explore &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vaux.net/services-archive&#34;&gt;Vaux&amp;rsquo;s archive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
