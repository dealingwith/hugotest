    Some perspective. Son Lux (BreakThru Radio Session) by Son Lux Whenever I need perspective I go find this photograph. It is the greatest regret of my life, leaving behind for even one second the daughter who would one month later be taken from me. When I go to work these days Lucy says &ldquo;Come back. Miss you.&rdquo; and leans in plaintively for a kiss. When I get home from work these days Lucy says &ldquo;Yay!

    I met Matt Alexander at XOXO this year. He&rsquo;s been a bit busy, but at the one other occasion I ran into him I complimented him on his writing for Need&hellip;turns out his degree is in English Lit. Then he drops this: In a world of carefully curated spheres of information and insight, it&rsquo;s all-too-easy for us to feel we&rsquo;re simply abiding by the societal norms dictated by those around us.

    The Travel As far as these things go, I thought my family did very well with the actual-travel portions of our Portland trip this year. (Here&rsquo;s last year&rsquo;s post, in case you weren&rsquo;t aware this has become an annual event.) The only hitch was when we arrived very late to Portland and were met with the worst domestic car rental experience I have ever endured. Whatever you do, never rent from Advantage Car Rental; they are terrible.

    Somehow in the last 9-10 months I&rsquo;ve gone from managing (seemingly) almost nothing to managing (seemingly) everything. This had made me feel very old. Like somehow one hits some age where one looks around and realizes no one is in control here and instead of continuing about one&rsquo;s life one takes control. And it all feels very overwhelming. I am now in a job with more responsibility (which, yea!), part (most?) of which is managing (three!

    My six months of sobriety technically ended last Wednesday but I&rsquo;m in what I&rsquo;m referring to as &ldquo;penalty time&rdquo;.{% fn_ref 1 %} And like penalty time in a soccer match, the imminence of the end makes the next week{% fn_ref 2 %} just feel like a long Friday. Or that part of summer camp where all the kids are getting picked up but you&rsquo;re one of the last few to leave.

    Almost two months since my last blog post. Yes, I&rsquo;ve been busy. I&rsquo;m also looking to change, yet again, how/where I publish my blog and kept thinking I would get around to that change before I posted again, but alas&hellip; Follow Up RSS reader of choice, current: feed.ly. I had to stop playing Minecraft due to a developing RSI. (The game, like all first person games, involves a lot of mouse moving.) I miss it almost as much as I miss real beer.

    Shipping again Shipped a major refactor/rewrite of our application this week, with a lot of help and a lot of long days. There are still some rough spots but this was a huge win for sanity and future velocity. I also accepted a full time offer this week (or was it the end of last week?), so that&rsquo;s official. Will be updating all the pertinent socnets as I get around to it.

    Shipping Last Friday was a 10 (billable{% fn_ref 1 %}) hour day after a 4 hours of sleep night. That (Friday) night was in the top three most difficult nights of my (brief, I&rsquo;ll admit) sobriety. But we shipped. And shipping is always good, if always a bit disappointing. There are always bugs that wait until after you&rsquo;ve shipped to reveal themselves. This is particularly true when there isn&rsquo;t a QA process in place but I think it&rsquo;s true regardless.

    Enjoyed a week of birthday celebrations. The evening of the 24th we had a guest for dinner and Carissa made salt-encrusted whole fish that was pretty much the best fish I&rsquo;ve ever had. Monday (my actual birthday) she took me to Stephen Pyles for lunch. We indulged in the &ldquo;Heaven and Hell&rdquo; cake, which was big enough for four. We had it for dessert that night as well. That night I opened my present from my parents, the Rapha merino boxes which I have since worn them on my bicycle commute and they are as advertised, even if I don&rsquo;t look as good as the guy in the promotional photographs.

    Lucy turned 15 months 10 days ago, which means it&rsquo;s about time for her 14 month photos to hit the internet. Momma is a busy photographer, besides which, Lucy is a demanding little red bear. So in case you missed it, here is the set and here is Carissa&rsquo;s post. These two are my favs: I love her eyes in the second one. It&rsquo;s like seeing the future.

    &hellip;wherein I lose track of the weeks and re-enter the proper workforce and long for the days when I had time to think about productivity and life direction. The contract I mentioned a while back as &ldquo;possibly turning full time&rdquo; has essentially done that, in so much as it has become a 30-hour-a-week contract, which, I&rsquo;m finding, consumes at least 40 hours of a week. The lower overall commitment level suites me fine for now, though, as I&rsquo;m still trying to finish up and/or start some side projects, one of the best evidences of which is the fact I&rsquo;m still titling these less-than-weekly minutial posts as weeknotes.

A development contract, some bartered web design work, the new record, two different side projects. And tomorrow my wife gets her picture taken for a feature in D Moms. Still not a lot to share about any of those things in said air. But I do want to share this talk by one of my favorite people, Aaron Draplin.

    Carissa asked what the titles of these posts were about. In case you also do not know, they&rsquo;re weeknotes, &ldquo;updates about what your business has been doing over the past seven days or so.&rdquo; In this case I don&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;business&rdquo; yet but I&rsquo;m simply counting from when I begin exploring new ideas and options following the end of my time at Extra Sauce. Also I just discovered, somewhat pleasantly, that I had counted incorrectly last week and that this is in fact week six and last week was week five, even though the permalink will forever hold my mistake.

And my wife, who I am so grateful for and who holds everything together with cuddles and baked goods. For the record, Lucy loves bicycles and bicycle paraphernalia.

I also rode my second-ever century (the first) on many roads I&rsquo;d never ridden on before, which was painful but left me with a great feeling of accomplishment.

    I really like getting up before dawn, drinking coffee and clearing my virtual desk in silence. This would have been inconceivable at any prior time in my life. I&rsquo;m officially old? I blame the bicycling for making me a morning person. Now on day two of week three of freelancing, aka being unemployed, and the business of the everyday continues to be both a burden and a blessing. I am getting to spend a lot more time with Lucy, which is amazing, and I constantly remind myself: that was the majority of the reason for this time.

Then there was the news that Nic Hughes had lost his fight with cancer. Then there was an acknowledgement of the similarities between Margot and Lucy and the moment I&rsquo;ve described as my biggest regret.

    Last weekend I attended the internet lovefest known as XOXO. A lot has been said already about XOXO. Here is every tweet posted during XOXO. Anil Dash live blogged the entire conference (it&rsquo;s really well done, if you&rsquo;re interested at all you should check it out). The speaker lineup was amazing. Here were some of highlights for me. Studio Neat&rsquo;s emphasis on passion, simplicity, narrative and actually putting the customer first all hit home.

    Lucy is eight months old. She is cute. She likes to point and wave hello and goodbye to people and this is indicative of how close she will tolerate your presence. Over there. Where she can wave to you. She is mommy&rsquo;s girl. If I step out of the room she begins an escalating whine until I come back and pick her up. Which, of course, I promptly do. She gives me kisses.

    Last weekend my sister, nephews, Carissa, Penn, Lucy, Pavlov and Ringo piled clown-car style into a rented Suburban and drove to Oklahoma to visit family and celebrate a 95th birthday. Lucy met a lot of new people and handled it great. Pavlov swam for the first time in his life (he&rsquo;s 9) and the dogs got to be dogs for the first time in a long time. Penn had fun every waking minute.

    5:45am: Lucy wakes up and nearly rolls off the bed, scaring the crap out of all three of us. 8:30: Penn and I leave for his SMU soccer camp. 8:50: We arrive 10 minutes faster than yesterday because I avoided that stupid section of Mockingbird east of 75. 9:15: Arrive at work. The day starts pleasantly and I have high hopes for a productive day. 10:15: Get a call from Penn&rsquo;s soccer camp.

    It didn&rsquo;t go so bad. I finished. I was doing ok until about 2 laps to go when I had that sudden feeling like all the blood was running out of my head and I watched the pack of riders disappear up the road in front of me. I actually did not know how many laps were left so when I came across the start/finish line by myself and saw the 2 laps remaining sign I also realized that I was going to finish the race w/o being lapped/pulled or otherwise not finishing.

    Intention I secretly hate this word. Most of the time I see it used it is referring to some ideal where every decision is cognitively aligned with some higher purpose, those decisions are always correct and time is never wasted. Additionally, intentionality and attention are closely related and frequently conflated. For my purposes what I mean by intentionality is most closely related to will. We intend to do something and we do that thing, as opposed to the easier thing, or the more short-sighted thing, or the more immediately gratifying thing.

    &hellip;managed to crawl out of bed in time to make the morning ride and I never regret it when I do. I pieced together a few different routes and we ended up with a really pleasant 54 miles. The temperature was pretty perfect (about 70F), the legs felt good, clouds protected us from the Texas sun (now they&rsquo;re watering our [still] parched land, which makes me even happier to have gotten a ride in early) and there were no flats or any other types of trouble.

    Her red hair is still red. In the sunlight it is extravagant. A shiny decadent red. It&rsquo;s growing longer and it&rsquo;s all coming in red. Passers by will comment and friends want to know where it comes from. It is a force and, as far as we know, she&rsquo;s the only red head in either of our families. Sure, maybe Cousin So and So was kind of red or Daniel has a red beard, but this!

    Industry{% fn_ref 1 %} It&rsquo;s somewhat obvious when sitting at one&rsquo;s computer writing or reading a blog post but much harder to own in a way that matters when making moment-by-moment decisions about how to spend one&rsquo;s time and structure one&rsquo;s life: industry is the key to most measurements of success or even lasting, life-affirming change. I haven&rsquo;t figured out exactly how to magically make my incredibly lazy bones start working hard every day, but I&rsquo;ve come across a few concepts that seem to be key.

    I started March out with great ambitions and plans, all of which I have failed at. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about that failure and how to adjust&ndash;either my plans or my behavior. I started, but never finished, a blog post about those goals. It said: The fact that [these goals] continued to come up as two things I wanted to do and deciding that I would commit the time and resources to doing them are two very different things.

    Took a short family trip to Oklahoma. I flew Carissa&rsquo;s brother Tyler down from Michigan, rented a van and took the five of us and two dogs to the country. Lucy met some extended family for the first time, Penn experienced the thrill of riding in the Polaris Ranger (time and time again), the dogs the thrill (and eventual agony) of running behind the Ranger (I would have to contain them on the patio to keep them from running far beyond what their little legs could handle).

    I took a few minutes over the weekend to redesign the single-page danielsjourney.com. The previous design was something I was really proud of and received a lot of attention, but its time had passed. This was also my excuse to check out Twitter Bootstrap, which I ended up not using (it is intended for web applications), and responsive web design which I knew a lot about but had yet to put into practice anywhere; and while this was a very simple example, it at least gave me the confidence of having implemented something.

    via Buster Benson. At our house we have a nightly ritual of listing three things we&rsquo;re grateful for. We&rsquo;ve had this ritual for a couple of years at least. Carissa instituted it, possibly as a countermeasure to a general negativity by the male members of the family. I&rsquo;m pleased to learn it has been contributing to our happiness.

    Guilt The Rapha Festive 500 is a worldwide challenge to ride 500km from the 23rd to the 31st of December. (Rapha makes very nice cycling garments as well as those cool videos I post all the time.) Last year it was the impetus for my return to regular cycling and the kickoff to a year filled with thousands of miles, new friends, lost pounds and a new appreciation for the further reaches of both my abilities and the town in which I reside.

    Hi. I&rsquo;m Daniel. I&rsquo;ve run a blog of some sort or another since 2001. I was originally on Blogger, then Moveable Type, then a little piece of software I wrote myself called SWIM. Then I ran away from what I considered &ldquo;normal&rdquo; blogging and was hiding away on LiveJournal for a while. Last year I started a blog using Jekyll. Now I&rsquo;m trying to move everything to Jekyll, which means every post will be an old fashioned HTML file here on my very own server.
