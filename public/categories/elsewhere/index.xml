&lt;p&gt;Because I don&amp;rsquo;t have a tumblr to post this on without attribution&amp;hellip;&lt;em&gt;update&lt;/em&gt; a friend pointed me here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.contemporist.com/2013/04/15/panorama-house-by-moon-hoon/&#34;&gt;http://www.contemporist.com/2013/04/15/panorama-house-by-moon-hoon/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dylanhollingsworth.com/Blog/post/2012/04/05/Aftermath.aspx&#34;&gt;Aftermath&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up visiting a neighborhood in Lancaster that got pretty torn up and walked through the neighborhood shooting and helping people where i could. The general consensus of those i spoke with was one of gratitude to be alive and that most of what was lost was replaceable. It is sobering and makes me realize that the good and bad things that shape my life are on their way. I don&amp;rsquo;t get to choose what day they get here. They are just coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often ride my bike through this area that was hit by one of the tornados that rolled through DFW on Tuesday. My friend Dylan chased the tornados and his thoughts afterwards resonated with me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Son Lux: Live</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/archives/2012/03/20/son-lux-live</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We interrupt the series in progress to bring you this important announcement: I just discovered a newish Son Lux live album, available at a you-name-it price on Bandcamp:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;100&#34; style=&#34;position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px; margin-bottom: 1em;&#34; src=&#34;http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=1033868237/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://music.sonluxmusic.com/album/son-lux-breakthru-radio-session&#34;&gt;Son Lux (BreakThru Radio Session) by Son Lux&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish there was a better way to say my mind was blown. &lt;a href=&#34;http://music.sonluxmusic.com/track/flowers&#34;&gt;Flowers&lt;/a&gt; was a song I couldn&amp;rsquo;t listen to before (because the lyrics were too evocative); the live version somehow changes the song enough that I really enjoyed it (even though, obviously, the lyrics are the same). But the main thing that hit me about the live EP is that, if listened to with certain ears, it has the same narrative arc I am trying to achieve with my next record. To hear that arc, you might have to live a day in my shoes, but I hope you can believe me when I say this record affected me in a way very few have. &lt;a href=&#34;http://blip.tv/btrlivestudio/son-lux-btr-live-studio-ep89-5900318&#34;&gt;Here is video from the session&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
