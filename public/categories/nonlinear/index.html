    I have what is probably one of the world&rsquo;s largest collections of personal data. &hellip;my consistent experience has been that the more routine I can make the basic practical aspects of my life, the more I am able to be energetic&ndash;and spontaneous&ndash;about intellectual and other things. &hellip;in time I&rsquo;m looking forward to being able to ask Wolfram|Alpha all sorts of things about my life and times&ndash;and have it immediately generate reports about them.

    &ldquo;Hi Ian,&rdquo; writes one. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed that the Cowpocalypse has happened and users have to pay to see their cow. Do you have a goal or timeframe of when this will be set back to normal?&rdquo; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way to pay to see your cow,&rdquo; replied the designer. &ldquo;The cows got raptured.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve written about Ian Bogost before, and recently two excellent articles recapping the history of his Cow Clicker Facebook game crossed by desk (via Marco).

    Ian Bogost makes a scathing critique of social games: Several years ago, Chaim Gingold gave us the useful concept of the Magic Crayon. A magic crayon is a tool that facilitates creativity in a way that wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise be possible. A magic crayon lets its users breathe life into things. Some would like to think that all crayons are magic ones. That just any old thing can conjure. But that&rsquo;s not true.

    The other day I wrote: &ldquo;What we do is make software. And software is best made by humans who understand each other (and by extension understand the people who use their software). Unless they’re miraculously made up of such humans, organizations make shitty software.&rdquo; And I just had some more thoughts about that: I don&rsquo;t want to make or work on software that sucks anymore. Life is too short to work on something that is shit to begin with.

    Maciej Ceglowski is one of the proprietors of Pinboard and also an amazing writer. His recent post describing technical aspects of the great exodus from Delicious (to Pinboard) has too many gems to capture them all, but here are a couple in case you need convincing when it comes to reading technical blog posts: Before this moment, our relationship to Delicious had been that of a tick to an elephant. We were a niche site and in the course of eighteen months had siphoned off about six thousand users from our massive competitor, a pace I was was very happy with and hoped to sustain through 2011.

    Usually a redesign of a one-page site of mine doesn&rsquo;t warrant a blog post, but this story is a little bit more interesting, mostly because of the work it built on. I haven&rsquo;t really told the story of a design before. I&rsquo;m curious how this will pan out. I was in my RSS reader last night after an ill-advised after-dinner coffee and saw Naz&rsquo;s post on Weightshift about the personal page&hellip;meme?

    Ftrain: The Web Is a Customer Service Medium. Paul Ford has been writing on the web longer than most and as usual this piece is excellent: What sums it up best, to me, is this image published on the blog Kotaku (if you know where the image originates please let me know). The image was posted as a comment on a blog post linking to an article about British computer- industry millionaire Clive Sinclair marrying a younger woman.

    Via BERG: &ldquo;John Kestner’s Tableau is a nightstand that drops photos it &lsquo;sees&rsquo; in its Twitter feed into its drawer, to be discovered by its owner.&rdquo; Tableau: physical email from John Kestner on Vimeo. John Kestner is part of the Information Ecology team at the MIT Media Lab, so of course I&rsquo;m going to gush a bit, but check out some videos of his other projects as well as the rest of his portfolio.
