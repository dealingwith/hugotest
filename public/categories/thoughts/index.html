    Sonder | The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows from John Koenig on Vimeo. Sonder &ndash; n. &ndash; the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own—populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness—an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.

    Somehow in the last 9-10 months I&rsquo;ve gone from managing (seemingly) almost nothing to managing (seemingly) everything. This had made me feel very old. Like somehow one hits some age where one looks around and realizes no one is in control here and instead of continuing about one&rsquo;s life one takes control. And it all feels very overwhelming. I am now in a job with more responsibility (which, yea!), part (most?) of which is managing (three!

    to (ride a bike) (write a blog) (take the train) (eat bacon) First there was XOXO and its admonishment to &ldquo;Work on something you are passionate about, because if it becomes successful you&rsquo;ll have to do it all the time.&rdquo; Then there was Bret Victor&rsquo;s talk on &ldquo;Inventing on Principle&rdquo;. Then there was the news that Nic Hughes had lost his fight with cancer. Then there was an acknowledgement of the similarities between Margot and Lucy and the moment I&rsquo;ve described as my biggest regret.

    This. About two years ago Daniel went to work and our late daughter, Margot, crawled to the door crying because she didn&rsquo;t want him to go. Last week Lucy did the same thing. I grabbed my camera because in that moment, everything in my head stopped and connected the two moments together&hellip; This has happened a lot, recently. I think it&rsquo;s because Lucy is finally nearing an age where we are ripe with memories of Margot and the similarities are beautiful.

    Today I found out Nic Hughes lost his ongoing fight with cancer. He was a loved husband, father, friend, designer and thinker. He was barely older than I. He was a peer and an idol at once. After Margot&rsquo;s death he wrote me: Dear Daniel, I think we’ve briefly met once and have occasionally exchanged email and comments from time to time. I talked to Steve at Greenbelt and he confirmed what I suspected from your twitter feed&ndash;that Margot did not make it.

      <div class="meta">Mon, Apr 16, 2012</div>
    </header>

    Intention I secretly hate this word. Most of the time I see it used it is referring to some ideal where every decision is cognitively aligned with some higher purpose, those decisions are always correct and time is never wasted. Additionally, intentionality and attention are closely related and frequently conflated. For my purposes what I mean by intentionality is most closely related to will. We intend to do something and we do that thing, as opposed to the easier thing, or the more short-sighted thing, or the more immediately gratifying thing.

    Industry{% fn_ref 1 %} It&rsquo;s somewhat obvious when sitting at one&rsquo;s computer writing or reading a blog post but much harder to own in a way that matters when making moment-by-moment decisions about how to spend one&rsquo;s time and structure one&rsquo;s life: industry is the key to most measurements of success or even lasting, life-affirming change. I haven&rsquo;t figured out exactly how to magically make my incredibly lazy bones start working hard every day, but I&rsquo;ve come across a few concepts that seem to be key.

    I started March out with great ambitions and plans, all of which I have failed at. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about that failure and how to adjust&ndash;either my plans or my behavior. I started, but never finished, a blog post about those goals. It said: The fact that [these goals] continued to come up as two things I wanted to do and deciding that I would commit the time and resources to doing them are two very different things.
