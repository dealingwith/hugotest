    Intention I secretly hate this word. Most of the time I see it used it is referring to some ideal where every decision is cognitively aligned with some higher purpose, those decisions are always correct and time is never wasted. Additionally, intentionality and attention are closely related and frequently conflated. For my purposes what I mean by intentionality is most closely related to will. We intend to do something and we do that thing, as opposed to the easier thing, or the more short-sighted thing, or the more immediately gratifying thing.

    Industry{% fn_ref 1 %} It&rsquo;s somewhat obvious when sitting at one&rsquo;s computer writing or reading a blog post but much harder to own in a way that matters when making moment-by-moment decisions about how to spend one&rsquo;s time and structure one&rsquo;s life: industry is the key to most measurements of success or even lasting, life-affirming change. I haven&rsquo;t figured out exactly how to magically make my incredibly lazy bones start working hard every day, but I&rsquo;ve come across a few concepts that seem to be key.

    I started March out with great ambitions and plans, all of which I have failed at. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about that failure and how to adjust&ndash;either my plans or my behavior. I started, but never finished, a blog post about those goals. It said: The fact that [these goals] continued to come up as two things I wanted to do and deciding that I would commit the time and resources to doing them are two very different things.
