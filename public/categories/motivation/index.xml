&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Intention&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I secretly hate this word. Most of the time I see it used it is referring to some ideal where every decision is cognitively aligned with some higher purpose, those decisions are always correct and time is never wasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, intentionality and attention are closely related and frequently conflated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my purposes what I mean by intentionality is most closely related to will. We intend to do something and we do that thing, as opposed to the easier thing, or the more short-sighted thing, or the more immediately gratifying thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t behave in certain ways if we didn&amp;rsquo;t secretly enjoy it. Be it stuffing our face with unhealthy foods or getting involved in a dramatic Facebook thread, it takes a strong will (or a life changing experience) to overcome behaviors that are contrary to our intent. (However I will be the first to advocate for a healthy hedonism in life.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tmcm.com/tmcm/i-wonder-whats-on-tv/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/files/2012/03/tv.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;I wonder what&#39;s on TV&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of biological reasons for this and I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to explore them right now. From a more philosophical perspective, Viktor Frankl would say that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=MmKta5tymPY&#34;&gt;our will to pleasure and our will power come from a frustrated will to meaning&lt;/a&gt;, which I frequently conflate with intentionality for my own purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meaning/calling/will/intentionality&amp;hellip;they all describe different characteristics of the self that we all accept as existent{% fn_ref 1 %} but have a hard time capturing practically either emotionally or intellectually. But it is the kind of thing &lt;a href=&#34;http://youtu.be/RYlCVwxoL_g?t=10s&#34;&gt;we know when we see it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Habit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, if we will ourselves to do something long enough, it becomes habit and our &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_control#As_a_limited_resource&#34;&gt;tired will&lt;/a&gt; can take a breather (before starting in on the next thing). I have a long-standing and slightly overly-obsessive interest in meaning and identity formation, but also with habit formation and behavior modification; and specifically in regards to the latter, technological tools that intend to help us change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before tools{% fn_ref 2 %}, however, are simply techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is quantification; keeping track of the behavior you want to change. It works for a variety of reasons&amp;ndash;by drawing our attention to the issue in question, by illuminating facts about ourselves we otherwise would not see&amp;ndash;and it probably works for a variety of non-obvious reasons as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will point you to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://quantifiedself.com/&#34; title=&#34;A place for people interested in self-tracking to gather, share knowledge and experiences, and discover resources.&#34;&gt;Quantified Self&lt;/a&gt; website as a rather complete and always expanding compendium of information on the subject. I will also point you to this video, which has a much more personal take on the same subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://player.vimeo.com/video/31401743&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;281&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other really important technique is accountability. This one is well known, but I have found this one thing to be helpful: don&amp;rsquo;t bother setting up accountability agreements with people particularly close to you{% fn_ref 3 %} and, if possible, arrange to be held accountable by a person whose primary interaction with you is around said accountability. Trainer, coach, therapist, pastor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another form of accountability is the use of a &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.beeminder.com/akrasia/&#34;&gt;commitment device&lt;/a&gt;, however I find they are best used in conjunction with&amp;ndash;not as a replacement for&amp;ndash;good old-fashioned human accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other techniques include a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_pact&#34;&gt;Ulysses pact&lt;/a&gt; (really a specific kind of commitment device) (refer also to &lt;a href=&#34;http://bustr.me/post/18441500095/why-loss-aversion-isnt-a-great-behavior-change-tool&#34;&gt;this commentary&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aversion_therapy&#34;&gt;aversion therapy&lt;/a&gt; and a host of others. In fact there are tons of good books on this subject that I should probably have read before writing a few paragraphs on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/C31NaEoD3WI?rel=0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Industry{% fn_ref 1 %}&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s somewhat obvious when sitting at one&amp;rsquo;s computer writing or reading a blog post but much harder to own in a way that matters when making moment-by-moment decisions about how to spend one&amp;rsquo;s time and structure one&amp;rsquo;s life: industry is the key to most measurements of success or even lasting, life-affirming change. I haven&amp;rsquo;t figured out exactly how to magically make my incredibly lazy bones start working hard every day, but I&amp;rsquo;ve come across a few concepts that seem to be key. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.deliberatism.com/blog/forget-self-improvement/&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; has it just right, but these parts rang true:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-help books and workshops arm us with ways to trick ourselves into doing things we perhaps should, but generally don’t want, to do. I ask whether this lack of will might actually be the universe trying to tell us something? What if the missing part of the puzzle is not a lack of willpower, but instead a lack of love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same blog &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.deliberatism.com/blog/seeking-passion/&#34; title=&#34;Seeking Passion&#34;&gt;later observes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to find something you love, you may need to change your search criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding an endeavor that fulfills you, is like finding a good friend or life-partner. It doesn’t “happen” to you, nor does it arrive with an announcement. Instead, it presents itself quietly and develops over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fellow Dallas technology entreprenaur Garrett Dimon recently referred to &lt;a href=&#34;http://garrettdimon.com/post/13601971410/tenacity&#34;&gt;tenacity&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that on the surface, we only see the success. We don’t see the work that went into achieving the success. We see the culmination rather than the 10 or even 20 years that went into getting there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hours they put in. The family events they missed. The vacations cut short. The travel. The times they were borderline bankrupt. The career-ending injuries that didn’t end their career. The nights they were homeless. The amount of bet-the-company decisions they made. The uncertainty they live through. The fear of letting down hundreds or thousands of employees. The mornings of waking up at 5am and practicing in freezing cold weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Attention&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to focus on the task at hand is vitally important to industry and increasingly difficult to achieve in our ever-connected, distractions-at-our-fingertips world. My inspiration in this area is my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D-4WKqjZR4&#34;&gt;grandfather&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/9D-4WKqjZR4?rel=0start=240&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve thought often about how he was able to maintain focus the way he did. I&amp;rsquo;ve blamed the internet and other circumstances for my own focus issues. But in the end I think he really was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol6VYp0naYA&#34;&gt;simply that enthralled and engaged with the things he worked on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/ol6VYp0naYA?rel=0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to observe how my focus changes as I context switch between the (still far too many) things I have chosen to do: cycling, music, coding, writing. Sunday I was in the studio and this week I find myself stopping to more intentionally listen to the music I normally play just to drown out my coworker&amp;rsquo;s conversations. I find myself contemplating my next record, what songs need to be learned, which people need to be recruited. &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.danielsjourney.com/2012/03/20/son-lux-live/&#34;&gt;I find myself blown away by new music&lt;/a&gt; that&amp;ndash;mysteriously&amp;ndash;crosses my desk during this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that one of the ways to succeed despite all the distractions and context-switching required by modern, connected life is to be able to focus quickly, and on the right things. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve said this exact thing before, and while I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find that post in the archives, I &lt;a href=&#34;http://2005.danielsjourney.com/categories/attention/&#34;&gt;have quoted and written a lot about attention in the past&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But John Lilly recently &lt;a href=&#34;http://john.jubjubs.net/2012/03/02/intentionality/&#34;&gt;stated something close to what I&amp;rsquo;m thinking&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m coming to view intentionality, depth of thought and connection, and the power to focus as the central developmental challenges of our society today. We&amp;rsquo;re going through an incredibly rapid transformation into an always connected, real-time, perma-entertained, ever stimulated world&amp;ndash;and it&amp;rsquo;s becoming clear to me that, somewhat ironically, it&amp;rsquo;s the people who can take advantage of all of that, while also ultimately staying within themselves, will be the ones who make the most profound and positive changes in our world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of us, however, especially those who were not born into the Internet age, will continue to struggle with the many tools of distraction at our fingertips, particularly when we find so many things so &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.danpink.com/archives/2012/02/how-to-say-no-especially-to-things-you-want-to-do&#34;&gt;very interesting&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now inhabit an environment (at least in much of the developed world) of abundant options and boundless, inexpensive information. That has triggered our dopamine-seeking instincts to pile too much onto our professional plates — which in turn has produced an entire infrastructure to help us avoid gorging ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But maybe the trick is to just relax and somehow find ways to be productive despite ourselves. Web and game developer extroidinare Shaun Inman &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theverge.com/2012/3/19/2822626/5-minutes-on-the-verge-shaun-inman&#34;&gt;recently confessed&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that I [stay focused]. I&amp;rsquo;m kind of all over the place, with my attention split between web apps, iOS games and apps, and Safari extensions. I&amp;rsquo;m not especially disciplined. I use plain old text files for todo lists. I try to limit my time on Twitter and in my inbox. If I feel my focus waning, I let it wane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that key ingredient of love comes up again as he concludes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiosity or that unpleasant feeling of leaving something unfinished usually draws me back to a problem or task before too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential down side of extreme focus is the possibility of concentrating on the &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; things and missing out on what is &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; important. More on that in future installments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% footnotes %}
  {% fn It is difficult to keep a post about hard work and concentration from becoming just a list of aphorisms. My hope for this piece was if I were to at least just write out some of my struggles it would help me find ways through them (and perhaps make for more interesting reading for those patient enough to continue with this series). I ended up&amp;ndash;somewhat ironically&amp;ndash;down many rabbit holes in the process. I hope I have compiled what I&amp;rsquo;ve found in an intelligent manner. %}

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I started March out with great ambitions and plans, all of which I have failed at. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about that failure and how to adjust&amp;ndash;either my plans or my behavior. I started, but never finished, a blog post about those goals. It said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that [these goals] continued to come up as two things I wanted to do and deciding that I would commit the time and resources to doing them are two very different things. In addition, they are frequently at odds with one another, especially when fit in around established goals like maintaining a happy family life and supporting it through growing a new &lt;a href=&#34;http://extrasauce.com&#34;&gt;business&lt;/a&gt;. In fact those established goals could take all of my time if I allowed them to. I&amp;rsquo;ve alternatively viewed additional goals as selfish or as sanity-retention. I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure which they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I am two weeks later and not only did I not make any progress on either of those goals, but I&amp;rsquo;m doing less work towards them than I did in February, when I was just flirting with them while going about my everyday life. Always the armchair psychologist, I want to figure out why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;A Tale of Two Bike Commutes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I bike commute to work&amp;ndash;and my car battery died while we were in Oklahoma so I&amp;rsquo;ve taken it as opportunity to force the habit&amp;ndash;I normally take one of two routes. &lt;a href=&#34;http://g.co/maps/gebdd&#34;&gt;One route&lt;/a&gt; involves riding down two of the most affluent streets in Dallas. A quick survey on Zillow indicates a median home price north of one million dollars. &lt;a href=&#34;http://g.co/maps/nc74t&#34;&gt;The other route&lt;/a&gt; (just a handful of blocks to the southeast) takes me through a more economically depressed and ethnically diverse part of town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When riding the former route I frequently wonder, &amp;ldquo;What do these people do to make so much money?&amp;rdquo;{% fn_ref 1 %} One time I arrived home and announced to Carissa, &amp;ldquo;I have a new goal to be eccentric and work from our house on &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Avenue,_Dallas,_Texas&#34;&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter route inspires me to be happy with less. I see people outside of their homes, talking with their neighbors. Old men give me puzzled looks from their front porch chairs. There are run-down houses and cluttered lawns, but there are also properties that are meticulously maintained. They communicate a level of care that doesn&amp;rsquo;t rely on financial agency. They have local markets they walk to. Their children play up and down the street. One time I arrived home and told Carissa, &amp;ldquo;All the stuff new urbanists are trying to create, these people have!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I covet the resources, space and comfort on display along the &amp;ldquo;rich&amp;rdquo; route, something deeper calls from the alternate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Contentment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always struggled with the balance between contentment and drive. I spent so much of my life discontent and striving towards some unknowable happiness that when I arrived at it &lt;a href=&#34;http://themusicgroup.org/track/what-am-i-supposed-to-do&#34;&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to do&lt;/a&gt;. More recent &lt;a href=&#34;http://2010.danielsjourney.com&#34;&gt;events&lt;/a&gt; then threw all ideas about contentment and happiness&amp;ndash;or even trust in a higher purpose&amp;ndash;to the wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/files/2012/03/calvin_history.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Calvin and Hobbes: History is the fiction we invent to persuade ourselves that events are knowable and that life has order and direction.&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But lately I have felt like I&amp;rsquo;m getting closer to this content-but-improving way-of-being. I&amp;rsquo;ve always admired people who seem totally content and yet continue to work hard and produce amazing things or live notable lives. &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Coyne&#34;&gt;Wayne Coyne&lt;/a&gt; comes to mind. I love the documentary &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fearless_Freaks&#34;&gt;Fearless Freaks&lt;/a&gt; mostly because it highlights so clearly the character qualities he has that have made him so successful&amp;ndash;mostly the ability and willingness to consistently work hard over a long period of time. My &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.danielsjourney.com/2012/03/10/stephen-wolfram-the-personal-analytics-of-my-life/&#34;&gt;recent post about Stephen Wolfram&amp;rsquo;s personal data tracking&lt;/a&gt; also accents these qualities of hard work and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was originally going to be one post, but as it became longer and longer I decided to break it up. Hopefully I continue with the rest of it. Next up: Industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% footnotes %}
  {% fn Back-of-the-napkin calculations: a one million dollar house with $28,600/yr property taxes (based on an example on Swiss) means costs of $74k/yr which requires an income of (with housing being 28%) a little over $264k/yr (that is not counting insurance or maintenance costs). So sure, there are plenty of professions where someone could make that much (or more likely a double income family could make that much) but for most of us an income in that range (consistently over 30 years) is unrealistic. %}
