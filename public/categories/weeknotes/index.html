    Carissa asked what the titles of these posts were about. In case you also do not know, they&rsquo;re weeknotes, &ldquo;updates about what your business has been doing over the past seven days or so.&rdquo; In this case I don&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;business&rdquo; yet but I&rsquo;m simply counting from when I begin exploring new ideas and options following the end of my time at Extra Sauce. Also I just discovered, somewhat pleasantly, that I had counted incorrectly last week and that this is in fact week six and last week was week five, even though the permalink will forever hold my mistake.

    *Update: &lsquo;This was originally titled &ldquo;Week Six&rdquo; but I&rsquo; There has been 100% less work done than planned. There has been Christmas, and lots of bicycle riding, and breakfasts, and dinner parties, and small tasks, and time with Penn and Lucy, and both of them being amazing in their own ways. And my wife, who I am so grateful for and who holds everything together with cuddles and baked goods. For the record, Lucy loves bicycles and bicycle paraphernalia.
