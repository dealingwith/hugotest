      <title>Novel Mobile-Specific Content Handling</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On my current project I was tasked with creating an iPhone-specific view with the constraint that it had to be the same page as the already-constructed desktop-optimized version and the requirement that content be moved in the new mobile view. For whatever reasons I&amp;rsquo;ve had rather mixed results device-sniffing with javascript in the past but almost universal success using media queries in CSS to target difference devices (and I was already doing so on this page). So I devised this scheme for determining if the viewing target was a mobile device and then moving the desired content appropriately. I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet figured out if it is clever or full of hidden perils. If you have an opinion give me a shout. It works and the only drawback I see so far is it requires an extra empty div on the page.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IP Followup: Music and YouTube</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One topic my &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.danielsjourney.com/2012/05/15/intellectual-property-primer/&#34;&gt;post from yesterday&lt;/a&gt; did not specifically address was music. Coincidentally, &lt;a href=&#34;http://waxy.org/2012/05/criminal_creativity_untangling_cover_song_licensing_on_youtube/&#34;&gt;Andy Baio recently posted a thorough investigation of cover songs on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; that speaks to many of the issues on both sides of the intellectual property debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all break laws. Every day, millions of people jaywalk, download music, and drive above the speed limit. Some laws are obscure, others are inconvenient, and others are just fun to break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are millions of cover songs on YouTube, with around 12,000 new covers uploaded in the last 24 hours&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, all but a sliver were illegal, considered infringement under current copyright law. Nearly all were non-commercial, created out of love by fans of the source material, with no negative impact on the market value of the original.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is creativity criminalized, quite possibly the most popular creative act that&amp;rsquo;s against the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s an act of civil disobedience; nobody&amp;rsquo;s making a statement. Most people don&amp;rsquo;t know that cover songs need a synchronization license, and even if they did, trying to get one is a confusing and expensive proposition&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, I set out to answer a seemingly simple question: when are YouTube cover songs legal, and how can we do this better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://waxy.org/2012/05/criminal_creativity_untangling_cover_song_licensing_on_youtube/&#34;&gt;If this subject interests you at all, the post is well worth your time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where I must admit I have used both legal and illegal music in YouTube videos, while playing gigs and even on one of the records I&amp;rsquo;ve released. I&amp;rsquo;ve had videos blocked and un-blocked by YouTube, in fact I have two currently blocked &amp;ldquo;in some countries.&amp;rdquo; Here&amp;rsquo;s one with two different songs, only one of which seems to have been identified by YouTube (and IIRC, caused it to be removed for a while).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/s3YTUIWfVzM?rel=0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpeUpIkpj6M&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s one that uses a cover song as its soundtrack (double jeopardy!?)&lt;/a&gt; that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been identified by YouTube. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiAm3bN2NSI&#34;&gt;This one&lt;/a&gt; is a questionable use of video (found on &lt;a href=&#34;http://archive.org&#34;&gt;archive.org&lt;/a&gt; IIRC) mashed up with someone else&amp;rsquo;s music, and was taken down by YouTube until the publisher reached some kind of agreement with them, then it was magically legal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4efpsTFmSOg&#34;&gt;there is this video of me performing a cover song&lt;/a&gt;. This is the very case addressed in Andy&amp;rsquo;s piece. It gets even more interesting, though, as the original venue I performed this piece in was responsible for the legality of my original live performance, and I have my doubts as to their fulfillment of that responsibility. Further, &lt;a href=&#34;http://themusicgroup.org/track/i-radio-heaven&#34;&gt;this is the song&lt;/a&gt; that I did not obtain a license for in the first place! I tried, desperately, going so far as to contact the band&amp;rsquo;s management, but was unable to secure a license through the channels offered me (mentioned in a post &lt;a href=&#34;http://2005.danielsjourney.com/blog/2009/12/30/2009-fives-part-2-fails/&#34; title=&#34;see number 1&#34;&gt;I linked to yesterday&lt;/a&gt;). (The two songs not performed by their respective copyright holders on &lt;a href=&#34;http://themusicgroup.org/album/memorial&#34;&gt;the Memorial record&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, were relatively easy to obtain rights for, in fact licenses for digital downloads had been established by the rights administrator.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me ranting about intellectual property rights &lt;a href=&#34;http://2005.danielsjourney.com/blog/2009/12/30/2009-fives-part-2-fails/&#34; title=&#34;see number 1&#34;&gt;is not new&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://2005.danielsjourney.com/blog/2006/12/20/this-guy-is-a-total-wanker/&#34;&gt;in any way&lt;/a&gt; but I wrote this in an email to my &lt;a href=&#34;http://extrasauce.com&#34;&gt;Extra Sauce&lt;/a&gt; coworkers after some confusion about what images they could use when posting to social networks on our clients&amp;rsquo; behalf and it seems like a reasonable summary of the subject and unfortunately still timely given the amount of copyright infringement sites like Tumblr and Pinterest engender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take-away: unless a photo or other piece of IP is specifically
licensed as public domain or &lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org&#34;&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt; licensed, we cannot use
it without permission of the original creator. If you cannot track
down the license or the original creator then that content is off
limits for professional use. With Creative Commons, things get a
little tricky. Almost all CC licenses require attribution&amp;ndash;that is
straight forward enough&amp;ndash;you need to include text in the post with the
original creator&amp;rsquo;s name and a link to the original content. Many also
require that the CC license be extended, in which case you also must
include text and a link to the original CC license. Most importantly,
some (or maybe most) CC licensed content specifically prohibits
commercial use, in which case it is still off limits for us to use for
our commercial clients (you can use it on your personal sites with a
clear conscience, however).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some places to find CC content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://compfight.com/&#34;&gt;compfight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/search/advanced&#34;&gt;flickr advanced search&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://search.creativecommons.org/&#34;&gt;search.creativecommons.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked at istockphoto.com as a place to find images to
buy on the cheap, but their prices have gone up significantly in the
last couple years. We tried one other stock photo site advertising
free images and the results were, as expected, abysmal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, a lot less content comes up when you specify CC. But remember if
you do find something that is copyrighted that you do want to use,
permission to use that content might be a quick email away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Videos and music are often embedded in a player that either allows or
disallows use on other websites. YouTube and Vimeo for example both
allow a content owner to prohibit the embedding of their content in
other sites, so if it IS allowed, it is implied that you have
permission to embed (but not download, redistribute, or re-use) the
content. Similar grey-area rules-of-thumb apply when posting a link to
Facebook or Twitter where a thumbnail or other linked copy of the
image is used along with the link. In those cases Facebook and Twitter
have set the precedent of what&amp;rsquo;s acceptable. In the case of Tumblr and
Pinterest, they are really off center when it comes to respecting IP
law and so we have to be careful as their TOS&amp;rsquo;s are carefully worded
to pass all the legal responsibility onto you, the user. Remember
what&amp;rsquo;s just questionable (while still illegal) for an individual to
post is very dangerous, murky legal water for a company to wade into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post reminded me to change my default copyright notice to a Creative Commons license.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Slowly Opening the Can of Worms: Editors</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/files/2012/01/software.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;This Software is AMAZING&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;The Worms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing greater than the number of text/code editors in the world are the number of developer opinions about them. There is the classic &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vim.org/&#34;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/&#34;&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; debate. There are constant comments about the languishing of the popular &lt;a href=&#34;http://macromates.com/&#34;&gt;Textmate&lt;/a&gt; (and pigs-have-flown exclamations at its recent 2.0 release). There are so many editors and development environments, in fact, that I must stop mentioning them now or risk a never ending paragraph burdened with commas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Pop-top&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;http://extrasauce.com/&#34;&gt;Extra Sauce&lt;/a&gt; we are not only platform agnostic (we pick the best stack on a project-by-project basis, although we have some tendencies) but we are tool agnostic. Within the development team we are split between Emacs, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sublimetext.com/&#34;&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://panic.com/coda/&#34;&gt;Coda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are all happy with our different tools for various reasons. So I ask this almost entirely due to simple curiosity: which editor do &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; use? Leave your reply wherever&amp;hellip;we&amp;rsquo;ll see it.&lt;/p&gt;
