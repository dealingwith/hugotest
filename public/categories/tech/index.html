    The final installment of XOXO posts, because a lot has gone on since then I also want to blog about An aerial drone view of XOXO {% youtube uf9rrskAV-A %} Speaking drones, Chris Anderson, former editor of Wired, now runs a drone company, delivered the first talk of the festival. Afterwards I was already mentally buzzed and ready to get back to Dallas and do awesome things&hellip; {% youtube ZeLF8LTePZI %} The first speaker I was really looking forward to was Maciej Cegłowski.

    Quotables from XOXO I want you to move here and make me things. Disruption&rsquo;s a great word, it&rsquo;s just been co-opted by a bunch of douchebags. &ndash; @waxpancake There&rsquo;s a field across the street full of goats, and now it&rsquo;s full of drones as well. Welcome to Portland. &ndash; @andymcmillan Aww daddy. We probably need to get a goat.” &ndash; @carissa Knowing what you&rsquo;re doing is not nearly as important as knowing your values.&rdquo; &ndash; @MaxTemkin Only rich people have the luxury of not talking about money.

    The Travel As far as these things go, I thought my family did very well with the actual-travel portions of our Portland trip this year. (Here&rsquo;s last year&rsquo;s post, in case you weren&rsquo;t aware this has become an annual event.) The only hitch was when we arrived very late to Portland and were met with the worst domestic car rental experience I have ever endured. Whatever you do, never rent from Advantage Car Rental; they are terrible.

    With Google Reader being shut down I wasted no time searching for another RSS reader (having not much love for Google Reader in the first place but not enough discontent to move away from it&hellip;until forced to). I&rsquo;ve ended up at NetNewsWire, the first one I thought about due to its longstanding good reputation in the Mac world. The interesting thing is that lately I&rsquo;ve been feeling a need to get back to the pre-Web-2.0 days of owning my own content.

    This video made the rounds a few months ago, and for good reason. It starts with some stuff that maybe only nerds can appreciate, but the end is dynamite. If you&rsquo;ve already seen it, it&rsquo;s worth a second viewing. If you&rsquo;ve never seen it, it&rsquo;s probably because you&rsquo;re not a nerd, and it&rsquo;s worth watching all the way through regardless&hellip; Bret Victor - Inventing on Principle from CUSEC on Vimeo.

    Last weekend I attended the internet lovefest known as XOXO. A lot has been said already about XOXO. Here is every tweet posted during XOXO. Anil Dash live blogged the entire conference (it&rsquo;s really well done, if you&rsquo;re interested at all you should check it out). The speaker lineup was amazing. Here were some of highlights for me. Studio Neat&rsquo;s emphasis on passion, simplicity, narrative and actually putting the customer first all hit home.
